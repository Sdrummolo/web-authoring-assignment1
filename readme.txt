Blackrocks Restaurant

Brief:
I propose to build a website to promote a high-end restaurant.
The website must be easy and intuitive to navigate, since it is directed towards
potential customers, of any age or background.
It's main objective is to make potential customers book tables as easily as 
possible, and to showcase the restaurant's menu and features.
